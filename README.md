 Analytics for Hospital Readmissions (Power BI + Python) 

The Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset is used in this study to examine hospital readmissions. The objective is to identify the primary causes of 30-day readmissions and provide actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. Stack of Technology Python (NumPy, Pandas) Power BI (interactive dashboards, DAX) GitHub and Git Dataset Diabetes 130: US hospitals from 1999 to 2008 Workflow 
1. Python is used to clean and process more than 100,000 patient encounter records 
2. To detect 30-day readmissions, the readmission flag was created. 
3. Designed elements like stay buckets, medication/lab flags, and age groups 
4. Exported a dataset prepared for Power BI 
5. Constructed Power BI dashboards for executives and risk drivers. Important Takeaways: Elderly patients 61+have higher readmission rates. Extended hospital stays raise the chance of readmission. Patients who use a lot of medication have more readmissions.
